This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model designed to predict the outcomes of League of Legends (LoL) matches and identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that influence the win probability at various stages of the game.

The models are trained on a dataset sourced from Riot Games' official API, consisting of 154,000 games.
